# Matrix Sequence

` This project allows you find the longest sequence of values sorted in ascendant order in
adjacent coordinates of a matrix formed by randomly distributed numbers.So basically we can run the project in two ways: `

- Unit tests
- Run through the terminal sending the sequence you want, separating each argument by a single space, for example:
  ` 3 4 9 8 7 6 21 60 12 5 1 2 3 4`

Where the two first arguments are respectively max rows = `3` and max columns = `4` and the another ones
are the numbers to build the matrix.

* `max rows argument = arg[0] = 3 `
* `max rows argument = arg[1] = 4 `

So `matrix size -> 12 = 3 * 4`
